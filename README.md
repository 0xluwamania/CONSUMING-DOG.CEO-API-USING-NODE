# CONSUMING-DOG.CEO-API-USING-NODE

This is a very basic NodeJS App that uses the fs and path module to consume the dog.ceo API. It reads a file that points to the name of a dog breed as a variable and uses the async function to await the api fetch call. This returns the link to the dog picture f found and the link is written into a file on teh backend.
